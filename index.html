		<h1>Jake's thoughts on Fly Fishing</h1>
		<p>Thanks for visiting! I'd like to tell you some things about fly fishing.

		<h2>"[T]his planet is covered with sordid men who demand that he who spends time fishing shall show returns in fish." -Leonidas Hubbard, Jr.
		</h2>
		<p>If you've never been fishing, you may think that the most important aspect is to catch a fish.  "Did you catch anything?" is always the first question asked by those who aren't familiar with this idea. Sure, catching fish is exciting, and in a time where supermarkets didn't exist, that was understandably the priority.  
		</p>
		<p>With fly fishing, the number one objective is simply to be fly fishing.  Catching fish is secondary, and is definitely not required.  Does the thrill of a fish striking your fly improve the experience?  Without a doubt.  But there is a good chance you won't experience this thrill very often when you first begin.  What makes this fun is standing in a river, feeling the movement of the world around you, and possibly enjoying an up beverage, if that's your bag.</p>

	<p>For all we know, there may not even be a single fish in that river. But come on, that setting is hard to beat. </p>

		<h3>If you're ever in Colorado, be sure to check out at least one of these great spots:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Eleven-Mile Canyon- Casting will be tight from shore, so don't try this without waders.</li>
			<li>The Dream Stream- Technically where the South Platte runs out of Spinney and into Eleven Mile Reservoir, this one can get pretty crowded, but often lives up to its nickname. Bring a windbreaker!</li>
			<li>Eagle River- Found in the same area as Aspen, Glenwood Springs, and the Maroon Bells Wilderness, you won't be able to turn your head without seeing more breathtaking scenery.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>For even more info about Colorado fly fishing, checkout my old fly shop's <a href="http://www.anglerscovey.com/">page</a></h4>
		<p>I always used to shop here, and they have some pretty good flies.  As to their site, it's stylistically appealing, and has an intuitive interface.  Rolling over the Items listed at the top drops down a menu of site nav options.  The photos, embedded videos, and forms all add to the effectiveness and aesthetics of the page. </p>
