		<p>If you've never been fishing, you may think that the most important aspect is to catch a fish.  "Did you catch anything?" is always the first question asked by those who aren't familiar with this idea. Sure, catching fish is exciting, and in a time where supermarkets didn't exist, that was understandably the priority.  
		</p>
		<p>With fly fishing, the number one objective is simply to be fly fishing.  Catching fish is secondary, and is definitely not required.  Does the thrill of a fish striking your fly improve the experience?  Without a doubt.  But there is a good chance you won't experience this thrill very often when you first begin.  What makes this fun is standing in a river, feeling the movement of the world around you, and possibly enjoying an up beverage, if that's your bag.</p>

	<p>There may not even be fish in that river, but that's probably of secondary signicance to this guy. </p>
